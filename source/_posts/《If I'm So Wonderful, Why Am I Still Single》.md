1. I have studied and written about couples who thrive, and I see that they are happy, not because they got luckier than all the rest of us when they found each other, but **because they passionately desire and believe in their happiness**. They do not dwell on their problems and differences but instead approach every situation with a spirit of good will

2. My deepest passion is helping people **free themselves from whatever is keeping them from love, and especially from a deep, pleasurable and nurturing bond with another special person.**

3. When I was single, I sensed a difference between me and my other single friends. 
>For one thing, **I seemed to be more determined and systematic in my search for love**. 
>
>And for another, **I was quite certain I would succeed**. 
>
>I actually carried around in my purse a list of all the qualities I was looking for in my ideal man. And I put the word out in as many ways as I could dream up. I tried personal ads and dating services. I attended singles events and stepped up my participation in my hobbies, such as folk dancing and theater. I actively encouraged all my friends to think of men who might be suitable for me.

4. I learned a critical lesson: Good fortune rarely comes in the form you expect it to. If you are single and searching for prospective partners, don’t limit yourself to people who you think are your type! Be willing to meet a wide variety of people. By screening too much at the beginning, you diminish your potential for serendipity.

5. The real problem is the extent to which love and work are incompatible activities. Too often, time spent on one is time unavailable for the other. Worse, love and work require opposite types of behavior. For example, to succeed in the “marketplace,” you have to be competitive, “businesslike,” wary of others, and committed above all else to the bottom line. To succeed in an intimate relationship, you need to be cooperative, flexible, emotionally available, honest, and committed above all else to the welfare of your loved one.

6. The Human Potential Movement valued “aliveness” more than achievement, pleasure more than profit, quality human relationships more than status or affluence.

7. Efforts to soften the clash between human-oriented values and production-oriented values have emerged in recent years.

8. Why do most Americans choose to manage stress rather than reduce it? Why do we end up with far more stress than leisure time? It’s because we fear that the price we will pay for reducing stress is sacrificing achievement, falling behind our fellow workers. And for most of us, this is too great a price to pay. Again, we value money and the things it buys more than we value a calm, pleasurable, loving lifestyle. We would rather have stress than leisure time.

9. But this is not a sociological book. Rather, it is about what you as an individual can do to find a satisfying intimate relationship. **I want to make only one point here: in your search for love, you need to recognize that society is not with you. **Singles looking for love today are like workers in search of jobs in the thirties: The forces around you are subtly but certainly working against love in your life. In his book New Rules, researcher Daniel Yankelovich summed it up when he reported that “most people choose financial gain over a more creative, self-fulfilling life.”

10. It was a critical step in our collective consciousness, for never before had we asked on such a widespread scale, “What do I want?”

11. But that brings us to a critical question: What do we do in the meantime, those of us who want love now and can’t wait around for the next phase of the revolution? That is the topic of this book.

12. In this book, rather than describing them one more time, I want to accept certain sociological and psychological factors as given and discuss what you as an individual can do if you want to overcome them. In my observation, singles use “the hard facts” as excuses for staying single rather than viewing them as obstacles to be overcome.

13. Finding love is a challenge today because: 
>• In general, work-place skills are taught, valued, and reinforced, and intimacy skills are not. Thus, it’s hard to find time for love, and when we do, we are ill-prepared for the demands an intimate relationship makes. We are good at work, but we aren’t as good at love. 
>
>• Men and women are at different phases of their political and social evolution. Women have learned about and become a part of “men’s world” faster than men have learned about and become a part of “women’s world.” Women have gained professional and work-place skills faster than men have gained interpersonal, emotional, nurturing skills. Men and women both become frustrated about what the other sex wants and what the other sex is able to give. 
>
>• In most geographical areas, the women who are available and looking for a relationship slightly outnumber the men who are available and looking. 
>
>• Fear of commitment is rampant among both men and women, but especially, it seems, among men. Large numbers of otherwise wonderful single men are resolutely opposed to—or somehow incapable of—making a commitment to a woman for a long-term, intimate relationship. 
>
>• Meeting eligible members of the opposite sex is not as easy as it was in college. Indeed, it is not easy at all. 
>
>• The rise of sexually transmitted diseases has introduced caution and awkwardness into the early stages of romantic encounters.

14. So why are you still single anyway? Just unlucky? Both to people who have found love and to those who have not, it feels like luck plays a large role:
>God, we were so lucky to find each other! What if one of us hadn’t gone to that party? It’s scary to think we might never have met! 
>
>Or: How did they get so lucky? Why can’t I find someone like that? Why not me??? 
>
>Luck may be a factor. But it is the purpose of this book to suggest that **the harder you work, the luckier you will get**. Luck needs help. And luck has a hard time breaking through if you continually stand in its way. Besides luck, then, why are you still single? Let me invite you to do an experiment.

15. For the first experiment, I invite you to answer for yourself the question “Why am I still single?” before you begin to read my theories about what the reasons might be. That way, as you read through my reasons, you will have a gauge. Is this a reason you already realized was a factor in your life? Is this a reason that doesn’t apply to you? Or is it a reason that does apply to you but that you had not been aware of? It may be interesting for you to see whether the reasons I suggest in the chapters that follow already showed up on your list in one form or another.

16. After you make your own list, compare it with the following “reasons I am still single” often given by participants in my workshops: 
>• I want to be alone. 
>• I haven’t found the right person. 
>• I’m still hurting from my last relationship. 
>• I’m working on myself; I don’t feel ready yet. 
>• I’m too busy. 
>• I see my friends pouring out their emotions on losing relationships. I don’t want to waste my time. 
>• I enjoy my privacy; I value my independence. 
>• My standards are too high. I’m too fussy, too critical. 
>• I don’t have the energy because my work is too important to me. 
>• I don’t have the skills to meet new people. 
>• Whenever I get close to someone, I back off. 
>• I don’t want to deal with the hassles. 
>• I keep hooking up with people who don’t want to become committed. 
>• I’m too hard to live with, too set in my ways. 
>• I don’t want to want love too much because what if I never find it? I need to prepare myself for that possibility. 
>• I’m afraid I’ll get into a relationship and later discover I don’t like it. Then I’ll feel trapped. 
>• I don’t feel as if I’m any good as a potential partner. I wouldn’t respect anyone who would choose me. 
>• I’m too needy. My desire for a relationship is too strong. 
>• I hate dating and looking. 
>• There’s a wall around my heart. 
>• I’m furious with the opposite sex and every member of it I meet makes me angrier. 
>• I’m afraid of failing a second time. One failed marriage is enough. 
>• I don’t want anyone to become too dependent on me. 
>• I don’t want to become too dependent on anyone else. • I want to get my career together first. 
>• If I make a commitment, I’ll lose myself. 
>• I’m afraid of being confined to a role. 
>• I’ve put in years convincing myself that it’s okay to be single!

17. The First Strategy: **Examine Your Hidden Ambivalence**

18. The most important prerequisite for finding a satisfying intimate relationship is wanting one. Wholeheartedly, genuinely, earnestly, single-mindedly, and without reservation.

19. Both kinds say, “I really want a wonderful relationship in my life.” But the first type really means it. And the second type, as it turns out, doesn’t. What the second type actually means is something more like, I want a relationship, but equally or more important to me is • not having to take risks • progressing in my career • hanging on to my great lifestyle • avoiding pain • keeping my secrets to myself • proving I’m right that the opposite sex is the problem.

20. Some singles are well aware of their ambivalence. They make statements like these: 
>• I want to be in a relationship, but I don’t want to give up all I love about being single. 
>• I want to be in love, but I’m afraid of losing control. 
>• I’m torn between my career and my love life. 
>• My lover is wonderful, but maybe I can do better.
>• I want to be married, but I’m terrified of another divorce. 
>• I’m afraid what I’ll gain won’t be worth what I’ll have to give up.

21. How certain are you about what you most want in your life? How high a priority is love for you? What are your competing priorities?

22. Intimacy is both appealing and intimidating. Singlehood is both freeing and lonely. Men are supposed to be successful and family-oriented. Women are supposed to eschew patriarchy but love men.

23. I once told a Gestalt therapist that I was trying to lose weight. “Trying isn’t enough,” she told me. “Here.” She threw a pencil on the floor. “Try to pick up this pencil.” I bent over and picked it up. “No,” she said. “I didn’t say pick it up. I said try to pick it up.” Then I reached and reached for the pencil. I touched it; I moved it. “I’m trying,” I said. But the pencil never got picked up. I got the message: Committing oneself to trying to accomplish a goal is very different from committing oneself to accomplishing the goal.

24. What to Do About Ambivalence It is not possible to undo ambivalence by an act of will. The only thing you can do is pay attention to it. As long as ambivalence remains unconscious it remains in control. It becomes a little voice inside you saying, “Careful. Don’t go too far. You’ll have to give up too much. Don’t move in together; you are moving too fast. On the other hand, don’t hesitate forever or you’ll lose out completely.”

25. The following experiments will help you get started on a program of paying attention to what you want most.

26. Thoughts occur in your head. Feelings occur in your body.

27. A Word to the Non-Ambivalent We have discussed ambivalence at length. But we should also take a look at what freedom from ambivalence looks like, for certainty, it turns out, has its own set of problems. Let us return briefly to the two groups we identified at the beginning of this chapter: 
>(1) involuntary singles who know what they want but haven’t found the right person yet, and 
>
>(2) involuntary singles who are ambivalent about what they want. The first group is composed of those rare singles among us who are not ambivalent. They are certain about what they want and determined to find it. And they will.

29. Patience without persistence is apathy, laziness, or indifference. Persistence without patience can easily lead to desperation, panic, anxiety, or depression.

30. The Second Strategy: **Ignore the Dread Statistics**

31. The Third Strategy: **Abandon the Myth That There Are No Good Ways to Meet People**

32. No-good-ways-to-meet-people is** a wonderful excuse** to stay single without having to take responsibility for it. By relying on this explanation, singles can protect themselves from falling in love and either being rejected or having to face all the fears and dangers they imagine love entails.

33. But something even more subtle may be going on, too: 
>the no-good-ways-to-meet-people excuse lets a single person **keep hope alive,** for all that stands between him or her and eternal bliss is some brilliant new magic method. That’s why meeting people is such a popular subject. It is one of those topics—like dieting—on which one can never get enough information.

34. Here is the secret. Ready? 
>It doesn’t matter. It doesn’t matter what method or methods you use. **All that matters is that you do something. That’s it. That’s the entire secret.**

35. Here, then, is my tried and true five-part formula for mate seeking: 1. Recognize that mate shopping is not necessarily fun. 2. Establish a master plan. 3. Go for volume. 4. Use the Two-Hour Date. 5. Screen for “relationship-style-preference” first.

36. Many singles allow loneliness, depression, and low self-esteem to keep them out of circulation. Yet you wouldn’t cancel a job interview just because you were feeling rotten. It’s an unfortunate irony that when you most need your good feelings about yourself—when you are out of work or out of love—that is when they are most likely to abandon you. But consider this: if you can force yourself to act anyway, you may have quite a positive experience which can make you feel a lot better.

37. In general, we seek partners who we feel are emotional and intellectual equals. If you are a person who has risen to the top of your field or who has developed a high degree of sophistication in some intellectual, emotional, or spiritual area, then you probably desire a mate who has a similar level of achievement or sophistication.

38. The advantages of the Two-Hour Date are obvious. Never again will you have the dreadful experience of realizing in the first ten minutes of an evening that a person is not your type, and still have to endure the whole evening.

39. The biggest danger I see in Internet matching services is that they inadvertently encourage you to screen too much, precluding the all-important element of serendipity. Most happy couples I know agree that, in some ways, they were not each other’s “type.” The likelihood that I would have selected my own husband from an Internet profile is extremely low.

40. There are two facts you should remember when you are trying to work up the courage to start a conversation with a stranger: 1. You will be doing the other person a favor when you start a conversation. That person is probably more shy than you are. You will help other people and flatter them by initiating contact. 2. It doesn’t matter what you say. You don’t have to be brilliant, clever, or witty. It is hard to avoid trite questions, so be trite. Or keep a few stock openers on hand like, “How do you know [the people who are throwing this party]?” The point is simply to get a conversation started. Truly, as long as you are not offensive or intrusive, it doesn’t matter how you do it.

41. No matter where you go, if you carry or wear or even drive something which is an obvious conversation piece, you make it very easy for other people to start a conversation with you. Conversation “inviters” can be almost anything from striking jewelry to an antique car. Pets give people a great excuse to approach you: a dog, cat, parrot, cockatiel, or even a chameleon. If you belong to a club or are active with a cause, wear a button or T-shirt. I know a woman who always carries a muff in the winter and gets endless comments on it.

42. Perhaps the most important overall clue to looking for love is, wherever you go and whatever you do, don’t take it too seriously. Of course, looking for love is a serious matter, but you don’t have to act serious. Keep your perspective and your sense of humor. Be willing to laugh at yourself. If you take it all too seriously, you won’t be able to relax.

43. The Fourth Strategy: Keep Your Standards High

44. When you are single, your world is full of experts who are eager to give you free advice. And one of the first things they will tell you is this: Your standards are too high; you have to be realistic. What you want doesn’t exist. Be willing to compromise.

45. So, rather than lowering your standards, you should figure out what you really want and make that your standard. Set yourself some specific goals—high goals—for what you want in a relationship. Then believe (or act as though you believe, which may be just as effective) that you will achieve what you desire.

46. By paying attention to your intuition, you can access a reservoir of great wisdom that resides within you. This inner wisdom will always steer you in the right direction.

47. The Fifth Strategy: Don’t Get Stuck in the Swamp Learning to Say No

48. The Consequences of Failing to Say No: BTNs When you aren’t able to say no at the right moment, you end up in a relationship—or a series of relationships—that are nice but not great, or great in some ways but mediocre in others. I have a name for these: I call them BTN relationships—Better Than Nothing.

49. Why Do We Stay in BTNs? BTN relationships actually waste precious time, and they are deadening. Yet virtually all of us have had the experience of staying in a relationship longer than we knew was good for us. Why? We stay in BTNs because we are hooked on security, and we hold on to the illusion of it even when we can clearly see that the relationship is degenerating. We feel safer staying in a known situation, however troubled, than venturing into an unknown situation, however freeing it might be.

50. 1. If you can, say something positive before or after you say no.

51. 2. State your position simply. Avoid getting into the realm of honest critical feedback, especially if this is a person you are not planning to see again.

52. 3. You are not responsible for giving a reason for saying no.

53. 4. Your no should be clear and effective.

54. 5. It is crucial to understand that—as long as you are kind and respectful—you are not responsible for how the other person responds to your no.

55. 6. For relatively casual no’s, standard formulas are an enormous help. Memorize some.

56. “Thank you for asking but I think I’d rather not.” “I had a good time with you last weekend, but I’m not in a place right now to pursue this relationship.” “I prefer not to continue dating, but I want you to know how much I have enjoyed [your sense of humor, your dancing skills].” (Be specific.) Never say, “I’ll call you” unless you mean it. By now, we should all be mature enough to avoid this trite, cowardly, dishonest cop-out. “Maybe we’ll see each other again sometime” is just as easy to spit out if you need a parting line, and far more respectful and honest.

57. The best way to learn how to say no is to practice. And practice really does make a difference. The next time you get together with a friend spend a half hour role playing no’s with each other. It’s best if you can think of an actual situation in which you had to say no—or should have said no—or still might say no.

58. The Sixth Strategy: Watch for Frogs in Royal Clothing Distinguishing Between Pseudo-Intimacy and the Real Thing

59. Infatuation Infatuation, also known as falling in love, is defined by the dictionary as foolish, extravagant, all-absorbing passion; irrational love or desire; blind love. Those of us who have been “in love” know that the experience can be wildly exciting. Both biologists and psychologists (to say nothing of poets and songwriters) have studied the phenomenon of infatuation in an attempt to explain the intensity and mysteriousness of it all. Biochemists hypothesize that an amphetamine-like substance, phenylethylamine, is released by the brain of an infatuated person, causing a natural drug-induced high. When the infatuation ends, the thwarted lover’s brain stops production of the “upper,” and the resulting pain, which can be agonizing, is like—or may actually be—drug withdrawal.

60. The Seventh Strategy: Beware of the Temporary Prince or Princess Avoiding Commitmentphobes

61. The Eighth Strategy: Don’t Try to Make the Prince or Princess Love You How to Handle an Intimacy Gap

62. The Ninth Strategy: What to Do When You Find Your Prince or Princess, But You’re Afraid of the Castle Learning to Say Yes

63. Finding the person you want to say yes to is a challenge, as we have seen. But actually saying yes is, for some, the most formidable challenge of all, because it means facing and overcoming fear.

64. After a while, it may even be quite difficult for us to distinguish between what we really are, at any given moment in our development as persons, and what we pose as being. It is such a universally human problem that we might justifiably call it “the human condition.”

65. The Tenth Strategy: Increasing Your Self-Awareness and Self-Esteem

66. So in order to make your survey of the reasons you may still be single really complete, you have to take a realistic look at yourself. Correcting major personality deficits is beyond the scope of this book. But most of us ordinary, wonderful people can benefit by looking at how we might make ourselves even more desirable (or less undesirable) as partners.

67. Special Challenges of Involuntary Singlehood: Loneliness, Balance, and AIDS

68. Ironically, you have to begin by accepting your depression. It is a mistake to fight it, because the more you resist it, the longer it will persist. Let yourself feel depressed.
